# Helm

### TODO:

1. Read about [helm](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=helm)
2. Read about [kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) 

### Final Exercise:
- Deploy minikube locally (single instance Kubernetes cluster).
- Write your own helm chart to deploy 2 Openwebui instances on your local minikube: 
    - One instance will be labeled as "production" and will use port 8080
    - One instance will be labeled as "dev" and will use port 9090
