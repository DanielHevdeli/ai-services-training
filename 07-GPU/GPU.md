2. What are the differences between GPU and CPU?
3. What are the use cases for using GPUs.
4. Read GPU architecture. What are the components that compounds a GPU?
5. What are the differences between various GPU architectures (Ampere,

6. What are the differences between NVIDIA's GPUs and other manufacturers' GPUs (AMD for example)
7. Write 0.5~1 page on why engineers decided to offload work from the CPU to the GPU (in the 1970's the term "GPU" didn't exist but the same offloading was done).
