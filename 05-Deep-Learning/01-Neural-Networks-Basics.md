### TODO:
- Watch [3Blue1Brown Neural Network](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) Episodes 1-4.
- Please write down a summary of every episode you watch and send your summary to your instructor.

- Why do we need a Neural Network, try to describe why we would use a NN to identify digits in an image rather than using a different approach.
- Try to describe in your own words what the activation in a neuron represents.
- Why do we need both a training data set and test dataset?
- A neuron in layer x of a NN is associated using a weight with every neuron from the previous layer. 
    - Why do we use sigmoid on the weighted sum?
    - Why do we add a bias to the weighted sum?
- Define what a loss function is.
    - What are the parameters of the loss function?
    - Ideally, you are looking to find the values of the loss function's parameter when loss=?
- Describe verbally the theory behind gradient decsent.
    - Define what a gradient is.
    - What are partial derivatives how are they used when you want to increase/decrease a multi-variable function's value?
- What is backpropagation?
- What libraries do people use to develop ML? When do you use each? What are the usecases?

### Bonus
- Watch [3Blue1Brown Neural Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) Episodes 1-4.

### Final Exercise:
- Implement your own Neural Network that predicts the digit presented in the image, just like in the video series. To challenge yourself and make sure you fully understand the match behind a neural-network, only use the numpy library (no other ML libraries), if you still want to use another library, ask your instructor. DON'T USE CHATGPT OR AN ONLINE EXAMPLE.
