# MLOps
During this section you are meant to understand the concept of MLOps, what it is, and what we aim to do as a team.

### TODO:
1. Roles and users involved in creating a model, what's a data scientist, what's a data engineer, what are the differences
2. [Google what's MLops](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=mlops)
3. Read this glossary about [MLops](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/mlops)
4. Search what tools we have in the TS. You don't need to know how they work, just what they do in a general sense. You'll get a deep dive into them in the future.
5. What do we currently provide in the cloud?
6. What's the ideal workflow for a data scientist to work, what role do we fill in their workflow as a team?
